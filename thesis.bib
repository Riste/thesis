abstract     = {The goal of the paper is assessing the quality of end-user tags from a video labeling game as a first step
 in the process of integrating them with the annotations made by professionals. Tags lack precise meaning, whereas the terms
 and concepts the professionals are used to have a clearly defined semantics given by structured vocabularies. Hence, we
 explore the possibility of mapping user tags to their semantic counterparts from domain and lexical vocabularies. Furthermore,
 we report on an analysis performed by a senior cataloguer regarding the general usefulness of the user tags in terms of
 video and fragment retrieval. Finally, we investigate the distribution of tags with respect to audio and visual portion
 of the video content.},
